# Classification with AI Techniques
In this project, I am using artificial intelligence techniques to solve a classification problem. I have compared several methods, including:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest
* MLP Classifier (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

In addition to these methods, I also implemented oversampling techniques using the minority strategy. This strategy involves oversampling the minority class in the dataset in order to balance the class distribution and improve the performance of the classifier.

Please note that this project is written in Spanish.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set).

To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the code. The results of the various classifiers will be displayed and compared.

This project uses the scikit-learn library to perform the tests.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I am always happy to hear your feedback and help improve the project.

Thanks for using this project!
